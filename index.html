      <p>2020 was challenging to say the least. Many of us have had to make tough decisions, or had to face financial
        difficulties. Since you are here, you have made the first step at looking for an opportunity to improve.
        Starting a new career might be hard, but I am here to guide you towards success.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>My name is Andras, welcome to my poker dealer academy.</strong> <br>

        <br>
        I have been working as a poker dealer for 8 years in London's leading casinos. During this time I have realised
        that those departments need a new and innovative way to provide high quality recruitment, and I have decided to
        establish a training school in London, Wimbledon.
        Having taught poker dealing in London for 2 years I gained substantial experience working with students from a
        wide variety of backgrounds. This has taught me the value of a unique, flexible approach and the importance of
        personal attention.
        <br>
        <br><strong><em>My mission is to train you to become a truly outstanding poker dealer.</em></strong>
